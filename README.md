# ML-Model-Digit-Recognition
A Python ML Model I've made that recognizes digits written and put into PNG file.

For training the bot, adding digits, and using the program make sure to follow the list below

Min = 1
Max = 12

Increase the Max number to whatever amount of digits you add, include it in the folder with the other digits, and name it digit(yournumber)

To train the bot, raise the number of Epoch and comment out the uncommented code, while uncommenting the commented code,
this will allow you to rebuild the training model, just remember to name "Handwritten.Model" something else and put it
in the same file.

Afterewards comment everything how it was and replace the loading code with your new model. Afterwards try again, to
get it more accurate you might want to also write better looking numbers, or change the neural network used.
