#This is a machine learning model that will predict the numbers in the "digits" folder
#To train the file properly you will need to raise the epochs, read the comments left at the end of "Write,py"
#The program is about 60% accurate, raising Epochs and recreating model would raise accuracy.
#Hope you enjoy!
